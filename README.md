# workout-log-server

Donovan, 
My server crashed towards the end of my project, and I was not able to fix it, even after consulting an instructor in the Learning Gym. I made it through finding an entry by ID successfully and got a successful outcome in Postman. Consequently, I do not have screenshots testing the Update and Delete endpoints, and have them commented out since I was not able to test run them. There's also some hidden error in my code. Here are some screenshots for proof of my work.
